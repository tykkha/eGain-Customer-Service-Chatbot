# Setup:

Step two: Execute chatbot.py (either in IDE or by executing "python3 chatbot.py")\
Step three: Follow the menu for your intended usecase

# Approach
As for my system when approaching projects, I tend to enjoy thoroughly reading the directions
and allowing myself time to plan and reflect on them before executing the design phase. After 
the design has a rough shape, I begin to hone both the design as well as begin implementing the 
foundation of the project, in this case the chatbot. Following these steps allows me to avoid
retracing my steps more than is neccesary due a lack of planning or oversight. 

# Examples 
Below are included user flows for the chatbot demonstrating normal usecases as well as the 
described scenario being a lost package. The customer that is experiencing the issue has the 
option of checking the current location and last update timestamp, recreating their order, or outright 
canceling the order. The option to speak with a representative is present at all times given the scenario
plans to have it connect to customer service, but the design is meant to negate the need for it, should
such team not be available in the scenario.
