Two of the biggest errors handling that would likely be experienced on a regular basis by end-users
would be invalid/mistaken inputs while traversing the menus as well as improper inputs for user data
(emails, order numbers, addresses). For the former, if an unexpected or disallowed input is received, 
the chatbot will reprompt the user with the previous choice, to hopefully allow them to reattempt and 
progress where they intended. As for the latter, basic forms of input validation for items such as emails
and addresses would be put in place as well as database lookups to confirm related information (emails/order numbers)
do infact match and can be correlated to one another as without such matching, a user with many orders could
experience errors when trying to retrieve updated information on a specific order.
